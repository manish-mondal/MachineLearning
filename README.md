# Project Sentiment Analysis On Review
Goals and Objectives
  
  Motivation:
  
        Ratings are subjective in nature as one person if somewhat likes a product and 
        gives 5 stars and some other person gives five star only when he/she is fully 
        satisfied with the product. Also one person’s worst rating does not clearly relate 
        with other person’s worst and vice versa. Hence we need to read actual reviews 
        to understand overall acceptance of a product.
        
   Significance:
   
        This will help to remove discrepancy if any between the given user ratings and 
        the actual sentiment of the product among users
       
   Objectives
   
        Classify product sentiment based on actual reviews provided by users
    
   Features
        
        Provide accurate review of a product/business
    
Results: 
  - Performed the testing on 9 combinations of machine learning algorithms like Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier and Gradient     Boost Classifier with Cross validation values of 3,5 and 10.
  
  - Able to improve the accuracy from 60% of Logistic Regression to 70% using gradient boost classifier.

# Assignment 3

Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?

Of all the Naive Bayes algorithms, Complement Naive Bayes has the highest accuracy (0.3953 percent).
SVM's accuracy is lower, at 0.209302.
Due to the unbalanced nature of the dataset, complement naive bayes provides the highest level of accuracy when compared to other naive bayes algorithms.
